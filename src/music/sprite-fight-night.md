I can hardly see; this chamber is dark, but I can<br />
Hear their voices screaming for blood, and I know<br />
I was not abducted to join a picnic<br />
Shackled to a cage, and I hear them shouting

“Step into the iron octagon”<br />
We have taken their kind but never like this<br />
“Step into the iron octagon”<br />
The crowd resumes its menacing hiss, I’m caught<br />
Sprite fight night

I have been here many times before but I never<br />
Thought I’d ever come to the fight on a mission<br />
In this place, the faeries are made to fight and<br />
Die for sport, and kill their kin while the crowd cheers

Step into the iron octagon<br />
Full nelsons don't work when your rival has wings<br />
Step into the iron octagon<br />
Bet on the winners and make out like kings<br />
Your ramen days are over<br />
If you pick your faeries right<br />
So grab your four leaf clover<br />
And come on - sprite fight night

It was in the woods I saw the men take her and I<br />
Followed close behind while they brought her downtown<br />
I knew then that I was responsible and<br />
I knew then what I had to do, before she’d

Step into the iron octagon<br />
It's better in person than on Pay Per View<br />
Step into the iron octagon<br />
You know this town's boring, what else would you do?<br />
You can't fight pugs or beagles<br />
Cause that'd be cruel, right? (Right!)<br />
But fighting sprites is legal<br />
So come on - sprite fight night

Tom what are you doing here, this is madness<br />
What have you betwixt your hands--is that water?<br />
You should not be back here without the handlers<br />
Who knows what these monsters will do if I don’t

Step into the iron octagon<br />
And come watch Titania fight Oberon<br />
Step into the iron octagon<br />
It's half pro wrestling, and half Pokémon<br />
The ticket booth is closing<br />
You know you want to bite<br />
So here's what I'm proposing<br />
Step right up - sprite fight night

Take your seats now ladies and gents<br />
The first fight is about to start<br />
Tom where are you taking me?<br />
I do not understand your plan<br />
Just duck and I’ll take care of it<br />
How well can you see in the dark?<br />
Sorry folks, a system glitch<br />
No need to panic; please stand by<br />
I was behind you, where’d you go?<br />
My legs are not as long as yours<br />
I’ve cut the power--now’s our chance, let’s<br />
Beat it while we can-- “Hey douchetruck,<br />
If you like the faeries so much you can go live with them!”
