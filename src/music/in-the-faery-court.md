Why’s she asking me to guard this one?<br />
Can’t we throw him through the Rift?<br />
I’ve been through quite enough today<br />
Without a dungeon shift

Hey!<br />
Never thought I would find you again<br />
But you made it out, I see<br />
Oh, now my luck has finally turned<br />
You’ve got to set me free

Hey, I know you! (Stop!)<br />
I can show you<br />
How to sneak away--<br />
You’ll have to wait, but I can…

\[spoken\]<br />
What?<br />
What?<br />
No, you tell me - what?  What's the plan?

Did you miss the things your monarch said?<br />
I’m not sneaking back to home!<br />
Her rants are long and I bore easily<br />
That’s why I tend to roam

Let me tell you what she told me, then<br />
She’s preparing for a war<br />
She wants to take things back to how<br />
She claims they were before

Do you agree?<br />
Would you kill me<br />
If she told you to?<br />
Your ruler plans to kill us all

All her power here is absolute<br />
Even when she dooms us all<br />
I do not want to wage a war<br />
But we live in her thrall

I cannot control her actions, Tom<br />
Nor can I delay her hand<br />
You bid me rise against my Queen<br />
But you don’t have a plan

So that’s it, then?<br />
Is it written?<br />
We’re all gonna die?<br />
There has to be some other way

Think what her battle will mean<br />
You will all take casualties too<br />
There are more of us than her and we can stop her if we try

Says the man whose whole experience<br />
Of the faerie court involves<br />
Getting locked inside a cage<br />
And not much else at all

Look, if we are to make a difference here<br />
We should start with something small<br />
Let me out of this prison cell<br />
And then we’ll show them all

On your feet, then<br />
Have to beat them<br />
There’s no time to lose<br />
Okay, so what’s the plan?<br />
I have one thought...<br />
\[spoken\] But we should probably talk about it on the way.
