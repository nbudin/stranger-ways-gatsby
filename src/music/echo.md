Oh, a merry fae went wandering to see what lay outside,<br/>
And I know to be true because that merry fae was I<br/>
They say that magic’s dead beyond the hedge’s hidden walls<br/>
But I think that wonder doesn’t die, it hides when shadows fall<br/>
And wondrous are the places deep and hidden I will find<br/>
For I’m sure I’ve but to listen and the earth will hum in kind

They‘ve tried to tell me do not go, for badly I will fare,<br/>
They may be right, I’ve heard about the men that rule out there<br/>
They say they're taking those who stray much farther than is smart<br/>
They’re vile, voracious, vicious things with iron in their hearts <br/>
Oh, these tales are so exciting! Did they think I’d be afraid? <br/>
...well maybe just a little, but I won’t be scared away.

I've always wanderlusted; I will take charge of my fate<br/>
For not much worth is safety when you’re stuck behind a gate<br/>
And so I went a-wandering, to see what lay outside,<br/>
And I sang with crickets and starlings, even made the old willow sigh<br/>
Oh, this world is just as wondrous as I knew that it could be;<br/>
So many creatures big and small to greet, befriend, to see… <br/>

I’m glad I went a-wandering and meandered down the path <br/>
That rambles through these woods without a sign of iron wrath<br/>
Perhaps I will find dangers still within the realm of men <br/>
But I can’t seem to believe that; all this world's a peaceful glen <br/>
But lo, what's this I merry see? A figure further down <br/>
Infused with magic just like me; this must be kin I've found! <br/>
What joy to have found suddenly a fellow fae as free as me! <br/>
The tales we’ll tell of how we’ve fared will become history!
