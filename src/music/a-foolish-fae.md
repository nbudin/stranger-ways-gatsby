Oh a foolish fae went wandering into the land of beasts<br />
Where magic isn’t dead, but is the food that monsters eat<br />
Run away you foolish fae before the human sucks you dry,<br />
Eats your magic, leaves you far from home, alone to die

Fear is like a banshee scream, rusalka kiss, a waking dream<br />
Flying through the woods to flee my newfound monster friend

We danced and laughed and bandied words, he seemed a kindred soul<br />
But now I see the game was me, a clever, hidden goal

Oh, she warned me she warned me that I was a fool<br />
To venture outside of the realm faeries rule<br />
For I am no hunter of monsters and so<br />
I’d make easy prey for a fearsome new foe<br />
But I did not believe the tales of what they’d done to us

The human seemed to understand the hidden courts of fae<br />
He spoke of leaving home, of discontentment and dismay<br />
Who knows what lies in the hearts of things that on magic’s arts do feed?<br />
But as I run, I realize... he thought I wasn’t me

And underneath that willow tree he seemed surprised as I<br />
But I hadn’t time to wonder, and for refuge I did fly

So now I fly through a strange, dark wood, alone without a map-- OOF!<br />

And you were so distracted that you ran into our trap<br />
Oh she warned you she warned you that you were a fool<br />
To venture inside of the realm humans rule<br />
For we’ve become hunters of monsters like you<br />
You’ll fight in our ring and we’ll see how you do<br />
For what your kind has done to us you’ll get what you deserve
