  When this song’s stuck in your head, and you want to kill us dead<br />
  We’re judging you, we’re judging you<br />
  Perhaps you should write a verse, but you think you’ll make it worse<br />
  Write away, it’s OK<br />
  But we’re judging you<br />
  <em>        – Emily L</em>
</p>

*[I’m Judging You][1] has turned out to represent some universal experiences for our listeners.  Even before releasing the song, we had written a sizable number of alternate verses, and after we began performing it, fans started writing their own.  We’ve collected as many of them as we can here.*

When you’re waiting at the station with increasing consternation<br/>

I’m judging you.

When your dog craps on my lawn, I just wish that you’d be gone.<br/>

I’m judging you.

**On conversational etiquette** - *by Emily L*<br/>
When you’re chatting with your friend and your listening you suspend,<br/>

You won’t know what’s going on.  The directions will be gone.<br/>
Take a look.  Where’s your book?!<br/>
I’m judging you.
